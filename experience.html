        <h4>Three-Dimensional Icons</h4>
        <p> Icons on maps allow people to locate and categorize places they may want to visit. I humanized those small icons that we see daily by making them three-dimensional, big, bright red, and dynamic. Because all of these icons share a similar visual language, they welcome the user to quickly identify them and scavenge for them as they walk inside the virtual environment. CiTY begins with the user standing in front of the first destination balloon, and this kindles the user to navigate the virtual environment in search of the second destination balloon. </p>

        <h4>Interactive Buildings</h4>
        <p> The design of the buildings generate a vibrant mood through their colors and textures. Some buildings change textures as the user approaches them, emphasizing the user's role in the story. This also brings out the element of surprise, as the user reads the messages on the buildings. One special building in CiTY plays a video of dynamic shapes that animate the space. Together, they work to create an engaging experience for the user.

        <h4>Trees + Street Lamps</h4>
        <p> These elements work together to guide the user forward as they walk in the environment. The trees change color, producing a sense of life and breath. The street lamps turn on as the user approaches them, highlighting the user's presence. 

        </p>

        <h4>Music + Sound Effects</h4>
        <p> These two elements cohesively tie the experience of CiTY and accents certain parts. Music immediately engages the user's audio senses and generates a convivial mood. Sound effects provide another level of feedback to the user as they approach certain objects in the environment. </p>
        
        <h4>Your Story </h4>
        <p> As the user walks toward the second destination, the buildings gradually blend into the background and become transparent. The further you walk, the smaller the buildings become. The user then towers over the buildings, which become building blocks to their future. The walk becomes a contemplative act and invites the user to reflect on their own lives and paths to their dreams. </p>

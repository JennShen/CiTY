      <h3>Welcome to CiTY</h3>
      <img src="img/Screen Shot 2017-03-29 at 5.48.53 PM.png">
      <p> CiTY stems from my experience in Chicago. The virtual environment captures the spirit of cities and accentuates their vibrancy and vividness. The story that CiTY tells is multifaceted, and details are divulged through the journey on macro and micro levels. On a macro level, you are invited to travel through the environment from Destination A to Destination B. All of the micro objects and their transformations lead you towards Destination B. </p>
      <br>
      <p>CiTY visualizes the icons that you find on two-dimensional maps into three-dimensional objects, including the destination, shopping cart, fork and knife, bed, camera, and teacup. They all symbolize activities that you can do at those areas. I designed those models to be large, red, and animated to exude approachability and tangibility. Many buildings change textures as you walk near them, generating a user-centered environment. CiTY highlights and celebrates your role in the environment as you pave a unique path from Destination A to Destination B. </p>
      <br>
      <p> There are many psychology principles manifested in CiTY, including Gestalt principles of grouping, simplicity, proximity, and similarity. Employing these principles generate a nuanced and fruitful experience. The different models, such as the buildings and three-dimensional icons, are grouped by materials, colors, textures, and transformations. The principle of simplicity apply to the buildings on the outskirts of the environment in order to make them a part of the background. I grouped different models closer together through the principle of proximity, which creates narratives within an overarching story. As for the principle of similarity, that is highlighted through all the three-dimensional icons, which are linked together through their similar color, material, movements, and large scale.

        <p> CiTY is an eclectic amalgamation of my experiences and imagination. I aimed to design an engaging landscape that has an overarching goal for the user along with other activities and sightseeing opportunities nested inside. Ultimately, the stories and visuals that I produced for CiTY can only be experienced in Virtual Reality. CiTY evokes a sense of familiarity and unfamiliarity, as my goal is to craft a story that resonates with the user and reverberates in the user’s mind.

        <p> Transformations and scripts are crucial to the virtual environment. Coding scripts to make engaging transformations require experimenting, experimenting, and more experimenting. I really enjoyed this process, and I created transformations including changing textures of the buildings and playing a video as a building’s texture. Layers of transformations are exciting and serve as beneficial feedback to the user’s presence in the environment.
